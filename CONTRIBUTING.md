The aim of the repository is to efficiently implement the [CURLoRA Research Paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12730055) within **HuggingFace**. 

Contribution, new ideas, collaboration and any kind of help will be much appreciated. 

When contributing to this repository, if possible but not required, please first let's discuss together the change you wish to make 
via issue, email, or any other method you prefer. I would like to learn from you. 

There is still a lot to do to enhance the code and a lot to be implemented like:
1. enabling CURLoRA within **Trainer and SFTTrainer** classes
2. enabling CURLoRA with **Quantization** to perform QCURLoRA. 

## When creating a Pull Request please:

1. Update the README.md with some explanation about the changes or fixes you made and/or added.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that your
   Pull Request would represent.
